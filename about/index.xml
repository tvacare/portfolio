I’m passionated about technology with a particular interest in the human side of software development. Studying code isn’t enough, you have to study the people behind the software, too. I also have interest in coding practices, system architecture and infrastructure. I decided to create this blog to write about technologies and I needed a way to write about new things whatever I discover or I’m working on.</description></item></channel></rss>
