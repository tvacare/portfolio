I've been wanting to write book reviews for a while now and finally I decided to do it. I was fully inspired by [Simon Hørup Eskildsen's book reviews](https://sirupsen.com/books/ "Simon Hørup Eskildsen's book reviews"). Most of the time I read a book review I feel more inspired to read the book and I also get to see other person's perspective on the subject. Reviewing books is really rewarding for me and is also a way to remember things that I've read.
