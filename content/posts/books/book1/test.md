I really like books with these small tips for your daily basis work, you start using it without even realising, which is great and this book is one of these.

"97 Things Every Programmer Should Know" is a book that each single "Thing" is written by a different author, and these authors are some very well known developers in the industry.

These are my favourites notes from this book:

> Technical debt is like a loan: you benefit from it in the short term, but you have to pay interest on it until it is fully paid.
>
> **_Chapter 1. Act with Prudence - Seb Rose_**

Well, we all have faced technical debt but we should really avoid it to the point that it starts getting hard to add new functionalities to the code or to even refactor the code. It's really important to understand the right time for a code refactor, otherwise the code might become really hard to support, so difficult that even small changes can have a bad impact. If this is already the case, you should really consider refactoring it. The longer you leave it, the worse it gets.

> Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depends on simplicity. - Plato

> **_Chapter 5. Beauty Is in Simplicity - Jørn Ølmheim_**

> "Betcha can't guess what it does!"he crowded
>
> **_Chapter 58. A message to the Future - Linda Rising_**

> People write software with people for people. It's a people business.
>
> **_Chapter 71. Read the Humanities - Keith Braithwaite_**

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
>
> **_Chapter 81. Test Precisely and Concretely - Kevlin Henney_**

It's always good to keep in mind that we write code for people to understand and that comes with simplicity. I always like to think that if something is too complicated, there might be a simpler way to do it. It's usually easier to make something complex than to make something simple.

> Consider the best programmer you've ever met: at one point, that person knew less about software than you do now.
>
> **_Chapter 36. The Guru Myth - Ryan Brush_**

It's always possible to achieve more and to learn more, that's one of the things that I like the most about technology: it is constantly changing and evolving and so should we.

Summarising, this is a great book with some very useful tips for good practices in Software Development that in fact every programmer should know.
