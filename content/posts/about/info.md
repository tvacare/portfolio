## ![Me on Christmas.](https://app.forestry.io/sites/mfzpywdqokx5kg/body-media//images/me.png "Me")

### I'm Thiago Vacare, Software Engineer; I've been working mostly with Golang and Node.js in the last few years. I'm passionate about technology with a particular interest in the human side of software development. Studying code isn't enough; you have to consider the people behind the software, too. I'm also interested in coding practices, system architecture, and infrastructure.

### I decided to create this blog to write about technologies; I needed a way to write about new things, whatever I discover, or I'm working. Hopefully, someone will find it interesting.

### During my free time, I enjoy riding my bike, running, or cooking.
