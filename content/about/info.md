## I’m Thiago Vacare. Software developer who has worked with Java, Node.js and currently Golang. I’m passionated about technology with a particular interest in the human side of software development. Studying code isn’t enough; you have to study the people behind the software, too. I have have also interest about coding practices. Coding is more about thinking than coding itself, and that’s one of the reasons I really like coding.

I decided to create this blog to write about techonologies and I needed a way to write about new things whatever I discover or I’m working on. Hopefully someone will find it interesting.

During my free time I enjoy riding my bike, running or playing the piano.
