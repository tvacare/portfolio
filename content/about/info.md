## ![Me on Christmas.](/images/me.png "Me")

### I’m Thiago Vacare, Software Engineer, I've been working mostly with Golang and Node.js in the last few years. I’m passionated about technology with a particular interest in the human side of software development. Studying code isn’t enough; you have to study the people behind the software, too. I have have also interest about coding practices and system architecture. Coding is more about thinking than coding itself, and that’s one of the reasons I really like coding.

### I decided to create this blog to write about technologies and I needed a way to write about new things whatever I discover or I’m working on. Hopefully someone will find it interesting.

### During my free time I enjoy riding my bike, running or cooking.
