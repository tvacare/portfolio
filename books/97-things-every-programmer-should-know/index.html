Act with Prudence - Seb Rose</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>Well, we all have faced technical debt but we should really avoid it to the point that it starts getting hard to add new functionalities to the code or to even refactor the code. It&rsquo;s really important to understand the right time for a code refactor, otherwise the code might become really hard to support, so difficult that even small changes can have a bad impact. If this is already the case, you should really consider refactoring it. The longer you leave it, the worse it gets.</p><blockquote><p>Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depends on simplicity. - Plato</p><p><strong><em>Chapter 5. Beauty Is in Simplicity - Jørn Ølmheim</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>People write software with people for people. It&rsquo;s a people business.</p><p><strong><em>Chapter 71. Read the Humanities - Keith Braithwaite</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.</p><p><strong><em>Chapter 81. Test Precisely and Concretely - Kevlin Henney</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s always good to keep in mind that we write code for people to understand and that comes with simplicity. I always like to think that if something is too complicated, there might be a simpler way to do it. It&rsquo;s usually easier to make something complex than to make something simple.</p><blockquote><p>Consider the best programmer you&rsquo;ve ever met: at one point, that person knew less about software than you do now.</p><p><strong><em>Chapter 36. The Guru Myth - Ryan Brush</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s always possible to achieve more and to learn more, that&rsquo;s one of the things that I like the most about technology: it is constantly changing and evolving and so should we.</p><p>Summarising, this is a good book with some useful tips for good practices in Software Development that in fact every programmer should know and it&rsquo;s also an easy read.</p></div><div class=post__footer><a class=pagination href=/about/info/ class="left arrow"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 26 26" enableBackground="new 0 0 26 26"><path d="M23.021 12.294l-8.714-8.715-1.414 1.414 7.007 7.008H2.687v2h17.213l-7.007 7.006 1.414 1.414 8.714-8.713C23.411 13.317 23.411 12.685 23.021 12.294z"/></svg></a></div></div></main></body></html>
